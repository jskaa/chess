chess- A Javascript-based chess engine. 
=====

A repo for an interactive game of chess 

The purpose of this project is to create a webpage which will run a javascript-based program that will allows users to play a full-blown game of chess with as much functionality as possible. 

Users will have to adhere and obey all of the standard rules of chess, as well as enjoy some functionality that many other chess engines do not provide, such as being able to turn a pawn into a different piece if the end of the board is reached.
